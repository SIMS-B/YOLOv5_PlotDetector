# YOLOv5_PlotDetector

This is an attempt to re-engineer ultralytics' implementation of YOLOv5. The aim is to make the model read extra information that can be provided in the labels and hence can be used to modify the loss function to enable content-aware training so it can eventually detect plot boundaries from satellite images
